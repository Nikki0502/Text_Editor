A collaborative text editor enables several users to share a text file and edit it. The file can be modified simultaneously by different users and the changes can be seen by other users simultaneously when one user applies a modification. An efficient implementation of such software should address coherency, file management, networking, and concurrency.

In this project, you are going to design and implement a simple version of a collaborative text editor. Your design should provide the basic functionalities of a text editor, handle concurrent accesses by multiple users over the network, and use a simple communication protocol between clients and the server.
